## Description
This project aims to provide a user-friendly Project Management Form that interfaces with a JsonPowerDB backend for storing and managing project data. The form allows users to enter, update, and reset project details such as Project ID, Project Name, Assigned To, Assignment Date, and Deadline. The data is stored in a PROJECT-TABLE within the COLLEGE-DB database using JsonPowerDB's powerful and fast real-time data processing capabilities.

This system is designed to ensure that project data is always up-to-date and easy to retrieve, while ensuring the reliability and speed of operations with JsonPowerDB.
